# O'Connell record

These are retained project-specific decisions, not universal building rules. Inspect current data and sources before modifying them; evidence-based corrections may supersede manual interpretations.

## Sources and file history

- Building ID `ocon`; O'Connell Technology Center, California State University, Chico.
- Sources: `csuc-floor-plans/ocon/ocon-1.pdf` through `ocon-4.pdf`. Four floors, each 612 × 792 PDF points, printed scale `1 inch = 30 feet`.
- Dates: floor 1, 2009-09-16; floor 2, 2003-10-07; floor 3, 2001-02-06; floor 4, 2008-08-05. Dates do not establish current conditions.
- App files: `src/data/ocon/floor-1.json` through `floor-4.json`, plus `connections.json`.
- `data/ocon-1.json` and flat `src/data/ocon-1.json` are historical paths, not copies to maintain. Root-level data initially followed “under data” literally; `src/data` was subsequently chosen because the loader imports it as app data. One floor per file, grouped by building, was preferred for manageable review and expansion.
- Existing `floor-*-preview.png` files were explicitly requested. They are local review artifacts, not app imports or files to commit. Prior generation does not authorize previews in future tasks.

## Origin and registration

`ocon-1-exit-lower-ao` is `(0, 0)`: the AO/wheelchair-marked exterior doorway on the right side of the lower lobby in the first-floor drawing. Its top-left PDF coordinate is `(443.4, 552.6)` points:

```text
xFeet = (pdfX - 443.4) * 30 / 72
yFeet = (552.6 - pdfY) * 30 / 72
```

Directions in descriptive IDs refer to drawing locations, not surveyed bearings. Upper floors were manually translated using the passenger elevator shaft, with the common scale/orientation retained. Add the following to the source floor's top-left PDF coordinate before applying floor 1's conversion:

| Floor | PDF X offset (points) | PDF Y offset (points) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 129 / 2.25 | -36 / 2.25 |
| 3 | 125 / 2.25 | -17 / 2.25 |
| 4 | 123 / 2.25 | -20 / 2.25 |

The numerators came from a 2.25-pixels-per-PDF-point rendering. Upper floors store equivalent projected origins and alignment metadata. This registration is approximate, not a survey; stair access points on different landings need not coincide.

## Thirteen inter-floor links

- West stairs: 1–2, 2–3, 3–4. Floor 1 retains `ocon-1-stairs-west-exterior-door`; other floors use `ocon-<floor>-stairs-west`. Preserve the first-floor exterior approach.
- Lower stairs: 1–2, 2–3, 3–4 (`stairs-lower`).
- Upper stairs: **1–2 only** (`stairs-upper`); no upper stair appears on floors 3 or 4.
- Passenger elevator: 1–2, 2–3, 3–4 (`elevator-passenger`).
- Service elevator: 1–2, 2–3, 3–4 (`elevator-service`).

The user first offered measurements, then explicitly chose “15 feet as base value for stairs and elevators for now.” The later instruction governs: distance 15, weight 1, provisional metadata on each adjacent-floor transfer. These are not measured story heights/stair runs. Stairs are inaccessible; elevator accessibility and service access are unspecified.

## Recorded doorway interpretations

- Floor 1: 106 via custodial; 127A via 127; 130A via 130; 133A connects 136 and 133. Retain the unnumbered space above 133A. A short outdoor edge connects the west stair exit and nearby corridor entrance. Langdon's neighboring outline is excluded.
- Floor 2: retain both ramps beside 255/249 with intermediate access; distances are plan-view with slope unspecified. 241 via 242; 244A via 244; 251A via 251; 249A via 249; 254A via 254. Retain visible unnumbered entrances.
- Floor 3: 347A via 347; 334A via 334; 349 also opens into 341. The compartment directly above the unnumbered room above 349 has no discernible entrance; no opening was invented.
- Floor 4: unnumbered service/mechanical entrances are included, but dashed equipment does not imply public circulation. No shortcut through the upper mechanical area is assumed. 436A lies between 436 and 438; 431A between 431 and 434; 432 has two doors. 431 shares open circulation with the lower stair lobby, so its approach is not an invented doorway.
- Only the three marked AO/wheelchair entrance edges on floor 1 were marked accessible. Paths through rooms and service spaces may be restricted in reality; the current types do not express all such restrictions.
- Overlay review caught straight lines crossing walls despite plausible endpoints. Preserve required bends and inspect multi-door approaches rather than optimizing only node count.

## Tooling and verification history

The original environment lacked `pdftotext`, `pdftoppm`, Python PDF modules, and Python venv support. Temporary `pdfjs-dist` plus `@napi-rs/canvas` under `/tmp` enabled vector-PDF inspection. This is a fallback, not a required dependency: use available tools, respect network approvals, and keep inspection packages out of the app manifest/lockfile. Temporary installations may not persist.

Prior final checks passed unit tests, coverage, lint, typecheck, build, smoke checks, and Docker configuration. E2E ran with no tests. Repository-wide formatting failed on an existing invalid workflow `if` expression in `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` and formatting in `src/main.tsx`/`src/styles.css`; changed files passed. These are historical results, not a license to skip checks or assume old failures/test counts remain current.
